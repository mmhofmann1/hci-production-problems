1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13+0u0k3SfK09rF1kkP8Ybtp9eW
Your Rationale: I picked this cool grey color because I feel that it correlates to technology well. Especially since consoles are hardware, blue is a cold color which relates to cold steel. Ultimately, it is grey because it is a new technology and helps fuel the idea that one day we will develop technology so much until it finally takes over humanity.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=52F0i0kiKJI00++arUSprwSujkG
Your Rationale: I picked this light pastel color palette because I think the light green colors represent the blossoming life that spring brings along. Yellow is also in this palette as its a happy, joyous color that relates to a fun event, in this case a tour.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31T0X0kzjzj9MRpm4CPCAl+Rg9v
Your Rationale: I picked this primary color palette as it is the core colors children should be learning at the age they learn the alphabet. They are also very bright and flashy colors. There are also easy contrary colors against the background that children will be able to read.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13+0u0kbTPp00++30XbkeJCuZOQ
Your Rationale: For this palette, I essentially took the first palette from the first question and just made everything a bit lighter. The same concept applies for the blue color as I feel the cool color blue relates to cold hard steel in technology. However, it should not be as dark and mysterious like a company would want when advertising a cool new gaming console. This particular palette is a bit more welcoming with its lighter colors as its trying to get people to sign up for the course.
