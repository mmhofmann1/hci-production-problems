## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/is-your-website-user-friendly-a-25-point-website-usability-checklist-info/528678/
2. https://html.com/blog/website-testing-usability-checklist/

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Quick site load time - Loading up a site should not make people leave because it struggles to load. Each page should be almost immediate
2. Easy to read content - The color of the content should adequately contrast the background. The font should also be easy to read. Spacing between the content needs to make it stand out and easier to identify/read
3. Navigation easily identifiable - Users need to look at a screen and be able to easily determine what link are clickable or buttons are usable.
4. Home page fulfills user's needs - If a user visits a food site, there should be clear links to placing an order, etc.
5. No horizontal scrolling - Keep the width of the content inside the page as it is annoying to scroll sideways
6. Consistent page design - Each page in the site should have consistent color and styling to avoid confusion
7. Easy to fill out forms - Do not require the user to input unnecessary information, keep it to the essentials for the site
8. Site is responsive - The site must be functional at different screen resolutions
9. Functional site - All of the buttons or interfaces must correctly work and do as the user would intend on them doing
10. Good flow of site - Users should be able to know where to progress throughout the site, from home page to order to cart, etc.
