## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://material.io/design/components/text-fields.html#usage
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Originally, the text fields were not discernible, as a text field looked like a button. Also, fields look the same when they do not have text or cannot be changed. I gave the membership field a drop down arrow so the user knows they can drop it down to select membership. Also, the donation field is always able to be used and it optional. It also looks different in that when the user hovers over it, the mouse cursor changes.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://material.io/design/color/#color-theme-creation
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: First, the black and white scheme of the site makes it hard to associate between objects on screen. Also, as art can very well be black and white, it seems a bit unfitting that an art website has absolutely no color at all. I took out the black grid lines and added a yellow background so it brings some life to the site.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://material.io/design/components/bottom-navigation.html#usage
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The navigation at the top of the site not only looks terrible, but it's only visible at the top of the site. Instead, I made a bottom navigation bar that stays there throughout the whole site. The bar has the same links as the original site.
